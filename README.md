# Router gps forwarding to the CerboGX

The following instructions are for enabling the forwarding of NMEA gps messages from 5G mobile cells without the need for a dedicated gps dongle. 

The messages are forwarded to a Victron CerboGX (or any device running the Venus OS)

## Hardware
GL-Net x3000 Spitz router (other OpenWRT routers may work)  
Victron Cerbo GX (or any device running the Venus OS)

## Router setup
Log into the routers web ui

Enable gpsd in the modems 5G settings

Open the cellular settings page â€¦

Enter the following two AT Commands.
```
AT+QGPSCFG="autogps",1  
T+QGPS=1
```

SSH into the router

Update the package manager  
```opkg update```

Install socat  
socat is used as it will continue to work even when the Venus OS is rebooted.
Note the installed socat is a busybox cutdown verson, and does not work. 

```opkg install socat```

Check gpsd is working  
```cat /dev/mhi_LOOPBACK```
 
Should see NMEA messages being output every few seconds. Ctrl C to quit
